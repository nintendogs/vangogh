        <p>death of van gogh</p>
        <p id="howdy">During his life, Van Gogh suffered poverty and mental
        illness. A well known instance is when he cut off his ear while
      chasing someone with a razor blade, then gifting the severed ear
    to a woman at a brothel. The townsfolk of his village agreed to sign him
  into a mental asylum. A year after he got out, under the watch of a doctor,
he was found in a field with a gunshot wound in his chest, assumed to be self-inflicted.
Two days later, with Theo by his side, he passed away - the date being July 29, 1890.</p>
